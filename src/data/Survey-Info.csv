Since the exact configuration of these displays and devices may not be known in advance, it is desirable for users to be able to reconfigure at runtime the dataflow between interaction devices and objects on the displays. To make this possible, we present the design and implementation of a prototype mixed reality system that allows users to immersively reconfigure a running hybrid user interface.},

The user interface features visualization methods and manipulation tools specifically designed for quick inspection and correction of typical defects resulting from automated segmentation of medical datasets.

  abstract = {While virtual worlds offer a compelling alternative to conventional interfaces, the technologies these systems currently use do not provide sufficient resolution and accuracy to support detailed work such as text editing. We describe a pragmatic approach to interface design that provides users with a large virtual world in which such high-resolution work can be performed. Our approach is based on combining heterogeneous display and interaction device technologies to produce a hybrid user interface. Display and interaction technologies that have relatively low resolution, but which cover a wide (visual and interactive) field are used to form an information surround. Display and interaction technologies that have relatively high resolution over a limited visual and interaction range are used to present concentrated information in one or more selected portions of the surround. These highresolution fields are embedded within the low-resolution surround by choosing and coordinating complementary devices that permit the user to see and interact with both simultaneously. This allows each embedded high-resolution interface to serve as a ""sweet spot"" within which information may be preferentially processed. We have developed a preliminary implementation, described in this paper, that uses a Reflection Technology Private Eye display and a Polhemus sensor to provide the secondary lowresolution surround, and a flat-panel display and mouse to provide the primary high-resolution interface.},

  abstract = {The post-WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menu and Pointer) user interfaces are creating new interaction modalities and the use of new input and output devices. Many of these new interfaces are not yet mature, and issues related with the clear definition of an application's context and technological requirements are still under investigation. The study of the relationship between the properties of interaction devices and their influence on the performance of 3D tasks (navigation, manipulation, and selection) is an important factor in the identification of adequate setups for carrying out these tasks. Evidences of this relationship are being described by new studies on interaction tasks. However, in a broader context, each task can be decomposed into subtasks whose technological demands can be a challenge, since they require multiple interaction environments as well as transitions between them. Therefore, this work proposes a hybrid technological setup to integrate the advantages of different functional environments. In order to achieve such goal, a semi-immersive environment composed of 3 functional environments was developed and transitions between these environments were exploited during a 3D annotation task in an oil and gas application.},

  abstract = {Traditional 3D User Interfaces (3DUI) in immersive virtual reality can be inefficient in tasks that involve diversities in scale, perspective, reference frame, and dimension. This paper proposes a solution to this problem using a coordinated, tablet- and HMD-based, hybrid virtual environment system. Wearing a non-occlusive HMD, the user is able to view and interact with a tablet mounted on the non-dominant forearm, which provides a multi-touch interaction surface, as well as an exocentric God view of the virtual world. To reduce transition gaps across 3D interaction tasks and interfaces, four coordination mechanisms are proposed, two of which were implemented, and one was evaluated in a user study featuring complex level-editing tasks. Based on subjective ratings, task performance, interview feedback, and video analysis, we found that having multiple Interaction Contexts (ICs) with complementary benefits can lead to good performance and user experience, despite the complexity of learning and using the hybrid system. The results also suggest keeping 3DUI tasks synchronized across the ICs, as this can help users understand their relationships, smoothen within- and between-task IC transitions, and inspire more creative use of different interfaces.},

While we find a common need for capturing how users perform tasks in MR, the primary differences were in terms of heuristics and metrics relevant to each project. Particularly in the early project stages, teams were uncertain about what data should, and even could, be collected with MR technologies. We designed the Mixed Reality Analytics Toolkit (MRAT) to instrument MR apps via visual editors without programming and enable rapid data collection and filtering for visualizations of MR user sessions. With MRAT, we contribute flexible interaction tracking and task definition concepts, an extensible set of heuristic techniques and metrics to measure task success, and visual inspection tools with in-situ visualizations in MR. Focusing on a multi-user, cross-device MR crisis simulation and triage training app as a case study, we then show the benefits of using MRAT, not only for user testing of MR apps, but also performance tuning throughout the design process.},

Our system enables different modes of interaction, content placement, and simulated AR HMD field of view to assess which combination is best suited to inform future researchers on design recommendations. We provide examples of how the framework could be used to create sample applications, the types of the studies which could be supported, and example results from a simple pilot study.},

We propose novel concepts and techniques addressing visualization-specifc challenges. By showing additional 2D and 3D information around and above displays, we extend their limited screen space. AR views between displays as well as linking and brushing are also supported, making relationships between separated visualizations plausible. We introduce the design process and rationale for our techniques. To validate Marvis' concepts and show their versatility and widespread applicability, we describe six implemented example use cases. Finally, we discuss insights from expert hands-on reviews. As a result, we contribute to a better understanding of how the combination of one or more mobile devices with AR can beneft visual data analysis. By exploring this new type of visualization environment, we hope to provide a foundation and inspiration for future mobile data visualizations.},

Their limitations are not well understood, most particularly in terms of input performance. We compare different AR-enhanced widget designs against their state-of-the-art touch-only counterparts with a series of exploratory studies in which participants had to perform three tasks: command trigger, parameter value adjustment, and precise 2D selection.

To analyze and understand how such collaboration unfolds, we propose four analytical lenses derived from an exploratory study of transitional collaboration with 15 dyads. While solving a complex spatial optimization task, participants could freely switch between three contexts, each with different displays (desktop screens, tablet-based augmented reality, head-mounted virtual reality), input techniques (mouse, touch, handheld controllers), and visual representations (monoscopic and allocentric 2D/3D maps, stereoscopic egocentric views). Using the rich qualitative and quantitative data from our study, we evaluated participants' perceptions of transitional collaboration and identified commonalities and differences between dyads. We then derived four lenses including metrics and visualizations to analyze key aspects of transitional collaboration: (1) place and distance, (2) temporal patterns, (3) group use of contexts, (4) individual use of contexts.},

Our approach aims to complement both MR and physical visualizations. Most current MR visualizations suffer from unreliable tracking, low visual resolution, and imprecise input. Data physicalizations on the other hand, although allowing for natural physical manipulation, are limited in dynamic and interactive modification. We demonstrate how mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets can serve as physical proxies for MR data interactions, creating dynamic visualizations that support precise manipulation and rich input and output. We describe 6 interaction techniques that leverage the combined physicality, sensing, and output capabilities of HMDs and smartphones, and demonstrate those interactions via a prototype system. Based on an evaluation, we outline opportunities for combining the advantages of both MR and physical charts.},

The traditional VR handle can realize tool simulation and 3D interaction, while smartphones can realize 2D interactions such as fast 2D gestures, text input and handwriting. Using the mobile phone as the handle of the MR headset can realize the complementary advantages of the two. In this study, we design a cross-device collaborative system sharing a hybrid reality environment. In the MR Environment, the smartphone will realize the functions of the controller for remote selection and manipulation of objects, and its advantages in 2D interaction can be well applied to some special tasks. We design the user interface with three levels of immersion: high, medium and low. High immersion: We provide a hybrid user interface combining a HoloLens2 and a smartphone. Medium immersion: We provide a 3D user interface represented by HoloLens2. Low immersion: We provide a multi-touch user interface represented by tablet. User studies show that the hybrid user interfaces can bring users satisfactory immersion and interactive experience, but it also needs to design accurate and efficient input methods according to the interactive tasks.},

The results inform a design space for context-aware ``peeking'' techniques that allow users to view or interact with desktop from VR, and vice versa, without fully switching. We implemented a set of peeking techniques and evaluated them in two levels of a cross-reality task: one requiring only viewing, and another requiring input and viewing.

Current approaches either rely on power-intensive sensors, such as cameras for hand tracking, or specialized hardware such as controllers. Previous work has explored the use of familiar, available devices such as smartphones and smartwatches as more a more practical input alternative. However, this approach risks interaction overload -- how can one determine whether the user's gestures on the watch or phone are directed toward control of the XR device or the mobile device itself? To this end, we propose a novel method for cross-device input arbitration based on the relative orientation between the HMD and target device as measured by on-device IMUs. In a validation study with 6 users, we demonstrate 93.7\% accuracy in estimating the intended device of interaction. Our method offers a practical, energy-efficient way to leverage users' existing devices for input and enable seamless cross-device experiences in XR.},

Participants were allowed to propose interactions belonging to various input modalities or a combination of interactions that utilize multiple input modalities. We labeled the observed data and analyzed the resulting 1200 input observations to derive a set of recommended interactions. We found that mid-air hand gestures Drag, Tap, and Grab were the most commonly proposed interactions and should be considered as the primary interaction for CR virtual objects transition assisted with other interactions and input modalities as the supplementary base on different user scenarios.},

  abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) head-worn displays (HWDs) allow users to view and interact with virtual objects anchored in the 3D space around them. These devices extend users' digital interaction space compared to traditional desktop computing environments by both allowing users to interact with a larger virtual display and by affording new interactions (e.g., intuitive 3D manipulations) with virtual content. Yet, 2D desktop displays still have advantages over AR HWDs for common computing tasks and will continue to be used well into the future. Because of their not entirely overlapping set of affordances, AR HWDs and 2D desktops may be useful in a hybrid configuration; that is, users may benefit from being able to work on computing tasks in either environment (or simultaneously in both environments) while transitioning virtual content between them. In support of such computing environments, we propose a prototyping framework for bidirectional Cross-Reality interactions between a desktop and an AR HWD. We further implemented a proof-of-concept seamless Desktop-AR display space, and describe two concrete use cases for our framework. In future work we aim to further develop our proof-of-concept into the proposed framework.}

Prior work explored leveraging a second device (e.g., Head-mounted displays) to extend the space where users can access large information space with virtual displays anchored on their wrists. Though researchers showed that having an additional virtual screen increased information bandwidth, little is known about the effect of virtual display sizes on users' performance. In this paper, we examined the impact of display sizes on spatial memory, workload, and user experience to better understand the prospects of virtually-augmented displays for smartwatches. Results from a user study revealed that a 4.8 inches display size can be the ``sweet spot'' for the virtually-augmented displays to ensure improved spatial memory performance and better user experience with less workload. Finally, we provided a set of design guidelines focusing to display size, spatial memory, user experience, and workload for designing virtually augmented user interfaces for smartwatches.}

We implemented the framework in an open source package called Alpaca. AR extensions developed using Alpaca appear as a web-browser extension, and automatically bridge the Document Object Model (DOM) of the web with the SceneGraph model of AR. To transform the web application into a multi-device, mixed-space web application, we designed a restrictive and minimized interface for cross-device event handling. We demonstrate our approach to develop mixed-space applications using three examples. These applications are, respectively, for exploring Google Books, exploring biodiversity distribution hosted by the National Park Service of the United States, and exploring YouTube's recommendation engine. The first two cases show how a 3rd-party developer can create AR extensions without making any modifications to the original web applications. The last case serves as an example of how to create AR extensions when a developer creates a web application from scratch. Alpaca works on the iPhone X, the Google Pixel, and the Microsoft HoloLens.}

In the system, which we named augmented TV, since animated 3DCG content interlocked with TV programs is overlaid on live video from the mobile device camera in the mobile device screen by augmented reality techniques, the representation of having a TV character coming out of the screen can be provided. To achieve the representation giving such surprise or reality to the viewer, synchronization accuracy of the overlay display is required. A conventional synchronization method for multi-device or a visible light communication method does not meet the requirement of the accuracy. Therefore, we developed an accurate synchronization method and authoring environment of augmented TV content. We implemented augmented TV, and confirmed frame-accurate synchronization (synchronization error time is about 0.03 seconds or less). And we confirmed that the authoring environment is easy to produce augmented TV content using a video clip using a 3DCG character with TV program quality.}

Although many researchers have proposed methods to resolve this issue, the inherent characteristics prevent these displays from delivering a readability on par with that of more traditional displays. As a solution, we explore the use of smartphones as assistive displays to AR HMDs. To validate the feasibility of our approach, we conducted a user study in which we compared a smartphone-assisted hybrid interface against using the HMD only for two different text lengths. The results demonstrate that the hybrid interface yields a lower task load regardless of the text length, although it does not improve task performance. Furthermore, the hybrid interface provides a better experience regarding user comfort, visual fatigue, and perceived readability. Based on these results, we claim that joining the spatial output capabilities of the HMD with the high-resolution display of the smartphone is a viable solution for improving the reading experience in AR.}

This approach aligns with the ``Seamless Reality'' concept, integrating physical and cyber space perception, cognition, and interaction. We detail the development of a prototype system and present findings from a user study that evaluates its effectiveness in a diverse range of AR settings. Our results underscore the potential of AR technologies in smishing detection, contributing to a safer interaction between virtual and real-world elements.

See-through head-worn displays overlay the virtual environment on the physical environment, visualizing the pervasive ""virtual ether"" within which all interaction occurs. Our prototype includes additional 2D and 3D displays, ranging from palm-sized to wall-sized, allowing the most appropriate one to be used for any task. Objects can be moved among displays (including across dimensionalities) through drag-and-drop.

Immersive analytics tools have recently emerged to support such analysis in situ, yet the complexity of the data also warrants an ex-situ analysis using more traditional non-immersive visual analytics setups. To bridge the gap between both approaches, we introduce ReLive: a mixed-immersion visual analytics framework for exploring and analyzing mixed reality user studies. ReLive combines an in-situ virtual reality view with a complementary ex-situ desktop view. While the virtual reality view allows users to relive interactive spatial recordings replicating the original study, the synchronized desktop view provides a familiar interface for analyzing aggregated data. We validated our concepts in a two-step evaluation consisting of a design walkthrough and an empirical expert user study.},

The multitude of problem sources hampers possible automated detection of such irregularities - providing a use case for interactive dashboards. With the advent of untethered head-mounted AR devices, these dashboards can be placed anywhere in the user's physical environment, leveraging the available space and allowing for flexible information arrangement and natural navigation. In this work, we present the user-centered design and the evaluation of IDIAR: Interactive Dashboards in AR, combining a head-mounted display with the familiar interaction of a smartphone. A user study with 15 domain experts for mobile intervention studies shows that participants appreciated the multimodal interaction approach. Based on our findings, we provide implications for research and design of interactive dashboards in AR.},

  abstract = {Biomolecular networks, including genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs), assemble the knowledge regarding the biological processes that happen inside specific organisms in a way that allows for analysis, simulation, and exploration. With the increasing availability of genome annotations and the development of powerful reconstruction tools, biomolecular networks continue to grow ever larger. While visual exploration can facilitate the understanding of such networks, the network sizes represent a major challenge for current visualisation systems. Building on promising results from the area of immersive analytics, which among others deals with the potential of immersive visualisation for data analysis, we present a concept for a hybrid user interface that combines a classical desktop environment with a virtual reality environment for the visual exploration of large biomolecular networks and corresponding data. We present system requirements and design considerations, describe a resulting concept, an envisioned technical realisation, and a systems biology usage scenario. Finally, we discuss remaining challenges.},

Thus, Bonfire is neither a pure laptop system nor a pure tabletop system, but an integration of the two into one new nomadic computing platform. This integration (1) enables observing the periphery and responding appropriately, e.g., to the casual placement of objects within its field of view, (2) enables integration between physical and digital objects via computer vision, (3) provides a horizontal surface in tandem with the usual vertical laptop display, allowing direct pointing and gestures, and (4) enlarges the input/output space to enrich existing applications.

To understand how potential users perceive virtual content on the ceiling and floor and how the content should be placed on these areas, we conducted two user studies. While the first exploratory study showed the general usefulness of either area, the second quantitative study allowed us to define optimal placement parameters regarding visibility and comfort. With insights from our studies, we provide design recommendations for future AR applications that support 2D content presentation on the ceiling and the floor.}

SymbiosisSketch leverages the complementary affordances of 3D (immersive, unconstrained, life-sized) and 2D (precise, constrained, ergonomic) interactions for in situ 3D conceptual design. A defining aspect of our system is the ongoing creation of surfaces from unorganized collections of 3D curves. These surfaces serve a dual purpose: as 3D canvases to map strokes drawn on a 2D tablet, and as shape proxies to occlude the physical environment and hidden curves in a 3D sketch. SymbiosisSketch users draw interchangeably on a 2D tablet or in 3D within an ergonomically comfortable canonical volume, mapped to arbitrary scale in AR. Our evaluation study shows this hybrid technique to be easy to use in situ and effective in transcending the creative potential of either traditional sketching or drawing in air.},

These interfaces although are intuitive to learn, may easily lead to inaccurate operations due to fatigue or constrained by the environment. In this work, we present Dual-MR, a novel MR interation system that i) synchronizes the MR viewpoints of HMD and handheld smartphone, and ii) enables precise, tactile, immersive and user-friendly object-level manipulations throught the multi-touch input of smartphone. In addition, Dual-MR allows multiple users to join the same MR coordinate system to facilite the collaborate in the same physical space, which further broadens its usability. A preliminary user study shows that our system easily overwhelms the conventional interface, which combines in-air hand gesture and gaze, in the completion time for a series of 3D object manipulation tasks in MR.},

  abstract = {See-through Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) offer interesting opportunities to augment the interaction space around screens, especially around horizontal tabletops. In such context, HMDs can display surrounding vertical virtual windows to complement the tabletop content with data displayed in close vicinity. However, the effects of such combination on the visual acquisition of targets in the resulting combined display space have scarcely been explored. In this paper we conduct a study to explore visual acquisitions in such contexts, with a specific focus on the analysis of visual transitions between the horizontal tabletop display and the vertical virtual displays (in front and on the side of the tabletop). To further study the possible visual perception of the tabletop content out of the HMD and its impact on visual interaction, we distinguished two solutions for displaying information on the horizontal tabletop: using the see-through HMD to display virtual content over the tabletop surface (virtual overlay), i.e. the content is only visible inside the HMD's FoV, or using the tabletop itself (tabletop screen). 12 participants performed visual acquisition tasks involving the horizontal and vertical displays. We measured the time to perform the task, the head movements, the portions of the displays visible in the HMD's field of view, the physical fatigue and the user's preference. Our results show that it is faster to acquire virtual targets in the front display than on the side. Results reveal that the use of the virtual overlay on the tabletop slows down the visual acquisition compared to the use of the tabletop screen, showing that users exploit the visual perception of the tabletop content on the peripheral visual space. We were also able to quantify when and to which extent targets on the tabletop can be acquired without being visible within the HMD's field of view when using the tabletop screen, i.e. by looking under the HMD. These results lead to design recommendations for more efficient, comfortable and integrated interfaces combining tabletop and surrounding vertical virtual displays.},

We are primarily interested in the exploration of 3D unstructured datasets such as cloud points or volumetric datasets. AR-HMDs immerse users by showing datasets stereoscopically, and tablets provide a set of 2D exploration tools. Because AR-HMDs merge the visualization, interaction, and the users' physical spaces, users can also use the tablets as tangible objects in their 3D space. Nonetheless, the tablets' touch displays provide their own visualization and interaction spaces, separated from those of the AR-HMD. This raises several research questions compared to traditional setups. In this paper, we theorize, discuss, and study different available mappings for manual spatial selections using a tangible tablet within an AR-HMD space. We then study the use of this tablet within a 3D AR environment, compared to its use with a 2D external screen.},

  abstract = {Distributed display environments (DDEs) allow use of various specialized devices but challenge designers to provide a clean flow of data across multiple displays. Upcoming consumer-ready head-worn displays (HWDs) can play a central role in unifying the interaction experience in such ecosystems. In this paper, we report on the design and development of Gluey, a user interface that acts as a 'glue' to facilitate seamless input transitions and data movement across displays. Based on requirements we refine for such an interface, Gluey leverages inherent headworn display attributes such as field-of-view tracking and an always-available canvas to redirect input and migrate content across multiple displays, while minimizing device switching costs. We implemented a functional prototype integrating Gluey's numerous interaction possibilities. From our experience in this integration and from user evaluation results, we identify the open challenges in using HWDs to unify the interaction experience in DDEs.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we examine the potential of incorporating transparent, handheld devices into head-mounted Augmented Reality (AR). Additional mobile devices have long been successfully used in head-mounted AR, but they obscure the visual context and real world objects during interaction. Transparent tangible displays can address this problem, using either transparent OLED screens or rendering by the head-mounted display itself. However, so far, there is no systematic analysis of the use of such transparent tablets in combination with AR head-mounted displays (HMDs), with respect to their benefits and arising challenges. We address this gap by introducing a research platform based on a touch-enabled, transparent interaction panel, for which we present our custom hardware design and software stack in detail. Furthermore, we developed a series of interaction concepts for this platform and demonstrate them in the context of three use case scenarios: the exploration of 3D volumetric data, collaborative visual data analysis, and the control of smart home appliances. We validate the feasibility of our concepts with interactive prototypes that we used to elicit feedback from HCI experts. As a result, we contribute to a better understanding of how transparent tablets can be integrated into future AR environments.}

We identify two general approaches for controlling a mouse cursor in SAR: perspective-based approaches based on raycasting, such as Nacenta et. al's Perspective Cursor, and geometry-based approaches that closely associate cursor movement with surface topology. For the latter, we introduce Everywhere Cursor, a geometry-based approach for indirect mouse cursor control for complex 3D surface geometry in SAR. A controlled experiment compares approaches. Results show the geometry-based Everywhere Cursor improves accuracy and precision by 29\% to 60\% on average in a tracing task, but when traversing long distances, the perspective-based Perspective Cursor and Raycasting techniques are 22\% to 49\% faster, albeit with 4\% to 10\% higher error rates.},

Our goal is to address the lack of immersion and intuitive input of conventional systems by providing spatial navigation to extract arbitrary slices from volumetric data directly in three-dimensional space. A 3D model of the medical data is displayed in the real environment, fixed to a particular location, using AR. The tablet is spatially moved through this virtual 3D model and shows the resulting slices as 2D images. We present several techniques that facilitate this overall concept, e.g., to place and explore the model, as well as to capture, annotate, and compare slices of the data. Furthermore, we implemented a proof-of-concept prototype that demonstrates the feasibility of our concepts. With our work we want to improve the current way of working with volumetric data slices in the medical domain and beyond.}

The 3DOF selection tasks is decomposed in part into a 2DOF positioning task performed by one finger on the tabletop in an absolute 2D Cartesian coordinate system and a 1DOF positioning task performed by another finger on the tabletop in a relative 2D polar coordinate system. We have evaluated balloon selection in a formal user study that compared it to two well-known interaction techniques for selecting a static 3D target: a 3DOF tracked wand and keyboard cursor keys. We found that balloon selection was significantly faster than using cursor keys and had a significantly lower error rate than the wand. The lower error rate appeared to result from the user's hands being supported by the tabletop surface, resulting in significantly reduced hand tremor and arm fatigue.}

Observations gained during semi-structured interviews with general users, and those experienced with 3D software, are used to define a set of design dimensions and guidelines. These are used to develop a vocabulary of interaction techniques to demonstrate how a tablet's precise touch input capability, physical shape, metaphorical associations, and natural compatibility with barehand mid-air input can be used in VR. For example, transforming objects with touch input, ""cutting"" objects by using the tablet as a physical ""knife"", navigating in 3D by using the tablet as a viewport, and triggering commands by interleaving bare-hand input around the tablet. Key aspects of the vocabulary are evaluated with users, with results validating the approach.},

To overcome these prevalent limitations, we developed and evaluated a multimodal interaction concept by pairing a smartphone as an input and output modality for mobile AR. In a user study (n = 24), we investigated the effects on interaction speed, accuracy, and task load for (1) virtual object manipulation as well as (2) interaction with established graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Our findings show that a smartphone-based AR controller results in significantly faster and more accurate object manipulation with reduced task load than state-of-art mid-air gestures. Our results also indicate a significant enhancement for using the physical touchscreen as a modality compared to mid-air gestures for GUI interaction. We conclude that interaction in mobile AR environments can be improved by utilizing a smartphone as an omnipresent controller. Additionally, we discuss how future AR systems can benefit from tangible touchscreens as an additional and complementary interaction modality.},

Yet, when used together in practical settings, AR and VR each offer unique strengths, necessitating multiple transitions to harness their advantages. This paper investigates potential challenges in Cross-Reality (CR) transitions to inform future application design. We implemented a CR system featuring a 3D modeling task that requires users to switch between PC, AR, and VR. Using a talk-aloud study (n=12) and thematic analysis, we revealed that frictions primarily arose when transitions conflicted with users’ Spatial Mental Model (SMM). Furthermore, we found five transition archetypes employed to enhance productivity once an SMM was established. Our findings uncover that transitions have to focus on establishing and upholding the SMM of users across realities, by communicating differences between them.},

   abstract = {This research investigates the use of hybrid user interfaces to enhance text readability in augmented reality (AR) by combining optical see-through head-mounted displays with smartphones. While this integration can improve information legibility, it may also introduce display switching side effects. The extent to which these side effects hinder user experience and when the benefits outweigh drawbacks remain unclear. To address this gap, we conducted an empirical study (N=24) to evaluate how hybrid user interfaces affect AR reading tasks across different content distances, which induce varying levels of display switching. Our findings show that hybrid user interfaces offer significant readability benefits compared to using the HMD only, reducing mental and physical demands when reading text linked to content at closer distances. However, as the distance between displays increases, the compensatory behaviors users adopt to manage increased switching costs negate these benefits, making hybrid user interfaces less effective. Based on these findings, we suggest (1) using smartphones as supplementary displays for text in reading-intensive tasks, (2) implementing adaptive display positioning to minimize switching overhead in such scenarios, and (3) adjusting the smartphone’s role based on content distance for less intensive reading tasks. These insights provide guidance for optimizing smartphone integration in hybrid interfaces and enhancing AR systems for reading applications.},

   abstract = {Desktop environments can integrate augmented reality (AR) head-worn devices to support 3D representations, visualizations, and interactions in a novel yet familiar setting. As users navigate across the dual realities—desktop and AR—a way to move 3D objects between them is needed. We devise three baseline transition techniques based on common approaches in the literature and evaluate their usability and practicality in an initial user study (N=18). After refining both our transition techniques and the surrounding technical setup, we validate the applicability of the overall concept for real-world activities in an expert user study (N=6). In it, computational chemists followed their usual desktop workflows to build, manipulate, and analyze 3D molecular structures, but now aided with the addition of AR and our transition techniques. Based on our findings from both user studies, we provide lessons learned and takeaways for the design of 3D object transition techniques in desktop + AR environments.},

   abstract = {Students often take digital notes during live lectures, but current methods can be slow when capturing information from lecture slides or the instructor’s speech, and require them to focus on their devices, leading to distractions and missing important details. This paper explores supporting live lecture note-taking with mixed reality (MR) to quickly capture lecture information and take notes while staying engaged with the lecture. A survey and interviews with university students revealed common note-taking behaviors and challenges to inform the design. We present MaRginalia to provide digital note-taking with a stylus tablet and MR headset. Students can take notes with an MR representation of the tablet, lecture slides, and audio transcript without looking down at their device. When preferred, students can also perform detailed interactions by looking at the physical tablet. We demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of MaRginalia and MR-based note-taking in a user study with 12 students.},

   abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) is a technology that superimposes digital information onto the real world. As one of the three major forms of AR, spatial augmented reality (SAR) projects virtual content into public spaces, making it accessible to collaborators. Due to its shared large display area, SAR has significant potential for application in collaborative design. However, existing SAR interaction methods may suffer from inefficiencies and poor collaborative experiences. To address this issue, CoPadSAR, a Pad-based cross-device interaction method, is proposed. It can map 2D operations from each Pad onto 3D objects within the SAR environment, allowing users to collaborate using multiple Pads. Moreover, a prototype is presented that supports collaborative painting, annotation, and object creation. Furthermore, a comparative study involving 40 participants (20 pairs) is conducted. The results indicate CoPadSAR reveals better group performance than controller-based, gesture, and tangible interactions. It has greater usability and provides a better collaborative experience. The interviews further confirm the user preference for it. This study contributes to expanding the application of SAR in collaborative design.},

   abstract = {We propose and study a novel cross-reality environment that seamlessly integrates a monoscopic 2D surface (an interactive screen with touch and pen input) with a stereoscopic 3D space (an augmented reality HMD) to jointly host spatial data visualizations. This innovative approach combines the best of two conventional methods of displaying and manipulating spatial 3D data, enabling users to fluidly explore diverse visual forms using tailored interaction techniques. Providing such effective 3D data exploration techniques is pivotal for conveying its intricate spatial structures—often at multiple spatial or semantic scales—across various application domains and requiring diverse visual representations for effective visualization. To understand user reactions to our new environment, we began with an elicitation user study, in which we captured their responses and interactions. We observed that users adapted their interaction approaches based on perceived visual representations, with natural transitions in spatial awareness and actions while navigating across the physical surface. Our findings then informed the development of a design space for spatial data exploration in cross-reality. We thus developed cross-reality environments tailored to three distinct domains: for 3D molecular structure data, for 3D point cloud data, and for 3D anatomical data. In particular, we designed interaction techniques that account for the inherent features of interactions in both spaces, facilitating various forms of interaction, including mid-air gestures, touch interactions, pen interactions, and combinations thereof, to enhance the users' sense of presence and engagement. We assessed the usability of our environment with biologists, focusing on its use for domain research. In addition, we evaluated our interaction transition designs with virtual and mixed-reality experts to gather further insights. As a result, we provide our design suggestions for the cross-reality environment, emphasizing the interaction with diverse visual representations and seamless interaction transitions between 2D and 3D spaces.},

In a within-subjects study in a semi-controlled public environment with 12 pairs, we compared physical display-only and PerspectAR configurations for data analysis tasks. Participants reported less physical workload with PerspectAR and spent more time near the physical display without compromising task performance. Feedback indicates that PerspectAR addressed perspective distortion and provided a contextual view that was useful as a memory aid. Due to the virtual screen curvature, PerspectAR was seen as less effective for tasks involving distance estimates between objects.},

Holistic usage scenarios in mixed reality involve tasks suited alternately to 2D or 3D information spaces. Yet, existing input devices excel in either 2D or 3D, but not both, making it necessary to switch between multiple input devices (e.g., mouse and VR controller). Our SpatialMouse addresses this issue, offering the affordances of a desktop mouse for indirect 2D pointing and the spatial capabilities of VR controllers with six degrees of freedom. In a user study with 12&nbsp;participants, our prototype significantly reduced perceived task load and improved user experience compared to switching between separate devices. We extract design recommendations to further support such hybrid input approaches.},

   abstract = {The global aging trend compels older adults to navigate the evolving digital landscape, presenting a substantial challenge in mastering smartphone applications. While Augmented Reality (AR) holds promise for enhancing learning and user experience, its role in aiding older adults’ smartphone app exploration remains insufficiently explored. Therefore, we conducted a two-phase study: (1) a workshop with 18 older adults to identify app exploration challenges and potential AR interventions, and (2) tech-probe participatory design sessions with 15 participants to co-create AR support tools. Our research highlights AR’s effectiveness in reducing physical and cognitive strain among older adults during app exploration, especially during multi-app usage and the trial-and-error learning process. We also examined their interactional experiences with AR, yielding design considerations on tailoring AR tools for smartphone app exploration. Ultimately, our study unveils the prospective landscape of AR in supporting the older demographic, both presently and in future scenarios.},

   abstract = {Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) environments require user interaction concepts beyond the traditional mouse-and-keyboard setup for seated desktop computer usage. Although advanced input modalities such as hand or gaze tracking have been developed, they have yet to be widely adopted in available hardware. Modern smartwatches have been shown to provide a powerful and intuitive means of input, thereby overcoming the limitation of the current AR/VR headsets. They typically offer a set of interesting input modalities, such as a touchscreen, rotary buttons, and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), which can be used for mid-air gesture recognition. Compared to other input devices, they have the benefit that they are hands-free as soon as the user stops interacting since they are attached to the wrist. As many concepts have been proposed, comparative evaluations of their effectiveness and user-friendliness are still rare. In this paper, we evaluate the usability of two commonly found approaches for using a smartwatch as an interaction device, specifically in immersive environments provided by AR/VR HMDs: using the physical inputs of the watch (touchscreen, rotary buttons) or mid-air gestures. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, where they tested both of the interaction methods, and we compared them in their usability and performance. Based on a prototypical AR application, we evaluated the performance and user experience of these two smartwatch-based interaction concepts. We have found that the input using a touchscreen and buttons was generally favored by the participants and led to shorter task completion times.}

  abstract=""A major concern in mixed-reality (MR) environments is to support intuitive and precise user interaction. Various modalities have been proposed and used, including gesture, gaze, voice, hand-recognition or even special devices, i.e. external controllers. However, these modalities may often feel unfamiliar and physically demanding to the end-user, leading to difficulties and fatigue. One possible solution worth investigating further is to use an everyday object, like a smartphone, as an external device for interacting with MR. In this paper, we present the design of a framework for developing an external smartphone controller to extend user input in MR applications, which we further utilize to implement a new interaction modality, a tap on the phone. We also report on findings of a user study (n=24) in which we examine performance and user experience of the suggested input modality through a comparative user evaluation task. The findings suggest that incorporating a smartphone as an external controller shows potential for enhancing user interaction in MR tasks requiring high precision, as well as pinpointing the value of providing alternative means of user input in MR applications depending on a given task and personalization aspects of an end-user."",

  abstract = {The proliferation of computing devices requires seamless cross-device interactions. Augmented reality (AR) headsets can facilitate interactions with existing computers owing to their user-centered views and natural inputs. In this study, we propose InputJump, a user-centered cross-device input fusion method that maps multi-modal cross-device inputs to interactive elements on graphical interfaces. The input jump calculates the spatial coordinates of the input target positions and the interactive elements within the coordinate system of the AR headset. It also extracts semantic descriptions of inputs and elements using large language models (LLMs). Two types of information from different inputs (e.g., gaze, gesture, mouse, and keyboard) were fused to map onto an interactive element. The proposed method is explained in detail and implemented on both an AR headset and a desktop PC. We then conducted a user study and extensive simulations to validate our proposed method. The results showed that InputJump can accurately associate a fused input with the target interactive element, enabling a more natural and flexible interaction experience.}

We propose using smartphones, which are also readily available, as companion devices complementing existing AR interaction modalities. We leverage user familiarity with smartphone interactions, coupled with their support for precise, tactile touch input, to unlock a broad range of interaction techniques and applications - for instance, turning the phone into an interior design palette, touch-enabled catapult or AR-rendered sword. We describe a prototype implementation of our interaction techniques using an off-the-shelf AR headset and smartphone, demonstrate applications, and report on the results of a positional accuracy study.},

We use Microsoft's HoloLens as a lightweight and easily maintainable AR headset and replicate existing visualization and interaction capabilities on both the PC and the AR view. We treat the AR headset as a second yet stereoscopic screen, allowing researchers to study their data in a connected multi-view manner.
