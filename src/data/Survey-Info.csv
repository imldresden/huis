To explore this concept, we designed and prototyped three demo scenarios: pulling virtual sticky notes from a tablet, pulling a 3D model from a computer display, and 'slurping' color from the real-world environment to smart lights with a virtual eyedropper. By merging the boundary of digital and physical, utilizing metaphors in AR and embodying the abstract process, we demonstrate an interaction strategy that harnesses the physical affordances to assist digital interaction in AR with hand gestures.},

The goal of the system is to facilitate efficient visual inspection and correction of surface models generated by automated segmentation algorithms based on x-ray computed tomography scans, needed for planning surgical interventions. Factors like the quality of the visualization, nature of the dataset and interaction efficiency strongly influence system design decisions, in particular the design of the user interface, input devices and interaction techniques, leading to a hybrid setup. Finally, a user study is presented, which characterizes the system in terms of method efficiency and usability.}

However, displaying content at the users' eye level might result in the occlusion of the real world. Therefore, it requires finding AR content placement areas that free the users' field of vision. In this work, we systematically investigate two content placement areas beyond the users' eye level: the ceiling and floor. To understand how potential users perceive virtual content on the ceiling and floor and how the content should be placed on these areas, we conducted two user studies. While the first exploratory study showed the general usefulness of either area, the second quantitative study allowed us to define optimal placement parameters regarding visibility and comfort. With insights from our studies, we provide design recommendations for future AR applications that support 2D content presentation on the ceiling and the floor.}

We implemented the framework in an open source package called Alpaca. AR extensions developed using Alpaca appear as a web-browser extension, and automatically bridge the Document Object Model (DOM) of the web with the SceneGraph model of AR. To transform the web application into a multi-device, mixed-space web application, we designed a restrictive and minimized interface for cross-device event handling. We demonstrate our approach to develop mixed-space applications using three examples. These applications are, respectively, for exploring Google Books, exploring biodiversity distribution hosted by the National Park Service of the United States, and exploring YouTube's recommendation engine. The first two cases show how a 3rd-party developer can create AR extensions without making any modifications to the original web applications. The last case serves as an example of how to create AR extensions when a developer creates a web application from scratch. Alpaca works on the iPhone X, the Google Pixel, and the Microsoft HoloLens.}

Their limitations are not well understood, most particularly in terms of input performance. We compare different AR-enhanced widget designs against their state-of-the-art touch-only counterparts with a series of exploratory studies in which participants had to perform three tasks: command trigger, parameter value adjustment, and precise 2D selection.

In the system, which we named augmented TV, since animated 3DCG content interlocked with TV programs is overlaid on live video from the mobile device camera in the mobile device screen by augmented reality techniques, the representation of having a TV character coming out of the screen can be provided. To achieve the representation giving such surprise or reality to the viewer, synchronization accuracy of the overlay display is required. A conventional synchronization method for multi-device or a visible light communication method does not meet the requirement of the accuracy. Therefore, we developed an accurate synchronization method and authoring environment of augmented TV content. We implemented augmented TV, and confirmed frame-accurate synchronization (synchronization error time is about 0.03 seconds or less). And we confirmed that the authoring environment is easy to produce augmented TV content using a video clip using a 3DCG character with TV program quality.}

Balloon selection allows for precise 3D selection in the volume above a tabletop surface by using multiple fingers on a multi-touch-sensitive surface. The 3DOF selection tasks is decomposed in part into a 2DOF positioning task performed by one finger on the tabletop in an absolute 2D Cartesian coordinate system and a 1DOF positioning task performed by another finger on the tabletop in a relative 2D polar coordinate system. We have evaluated balloon selection in a formal user study that compared it to two well-known interaction techniques for selecting a static 3D target: a 3DOF tracked wand and keyboard cursor keys. We found that balloon selection was significantly faster than using cursor keys and had a significantly lower error rate than the wand. The lower error rate appeared to result from the user's hands being supported by the tabletop surface, resulting in significantly reduced hand tremor and arm fatigue.}

Additional mobile devices have long been successfully used in head-mounted AR, but they obscure the visual context and real world objects during interaction. Transparent tangible displays can address this problem, using either transparent OLED screens or rendering by the head-mounted display itself. However, so far, there is no systematic analysis of the use of such transparent tablets in combination with AR head-mounted displays (HMDs), with respect to their benefits and arising challenges. We address this gap by introducing a research platform based on a touch-enabled, transparent interaction panel, for which we present our custom hardware design and software stack in detail. Furthermore, we developed a series of interaction concepts for this platform and demonstrate them in the context of three use case scenarios: the exploration of 3D volumetric data, collaborative visual data analysis, and the control of smart home appliances. We validate the feasibility of our concepts with interactive prototypes that we used to elicit feedback from HCI experts. As a result, we contribute to a better understanding of how transparent tablets can be integrated into future AR environments.}

  abstract = {Transitional Interfaces are a yet underexplored, emerging class of cross-reality user interfaces that enable users to freely move along the reality-virtuality continuum during collaboration. To analyze and understand how such collaboration unfolds, we propose four analytical lenses derived from an exploratory study of transitional collaboration with 15 dyads. While solving a complex spatial optimization task, participants could freely switch between three contexts, each with different displays (desktop screens, tablet-based augmented reality, head-mounted virtual reality), input techniques (mouse, touch, handheld controllers), and visual representations (monoscopic and allocentric 2D/3D maps, stereoscopic egocentric views). Using the rich qualitative and quantitative data from our study, we evaluated participants' perceptions of transitional collaboration and identified commonalities and differences between dyads. We then derived four lenses including metrics and visualizations to analyze key aspects of transitional collaboration: (1) place and distance, (2) temporal patterns, (3) group use of contexts, (4) individual use of contexts.},

This paper proposes a solution to this problem using a coordinated, tablet- and HMD-based, hybrid virtual environment system. Wearing a non-occlusive HMD, the user is able to view and interact with a tablet mounted on the non-dominant forearm, which provides a multi-touch interaction surface, as well as an exocentric God view of the virtual world. To reduce transition gaps across 3D interaction tasks and interfaces, four coordination mechanisms are proposed, two of which were implemented, and one was evaluated in a user study featuring complex level-editing tasks. Based on subjective ratings, task performance, interview feedback, and video analysis, we found that having multiple Interaction Contexts (ICs) with complementary benefits can lead to good performance and user experience, despite the complexity of learning and using the hybrid system. The results also suggest keeping 3DUI tasks synchronized across the ICs, as this can help users understand their relationships, smoothen within- and between-task IC transitions, and inspire more creative use of different interfaces.},

Many of these new interfaces are not yet mature, and issues related with the clear definition of an application's context and technological requirements are still under investigation. The study of the relationship between the properties of interaction devices and their influence on the performance of 3D tasks (navigation, manipulation, and selection) is an important factor in the identification of adequate setups for carrying out these tasks. Evidences of this relationship are being described by new studies on interaction tasks. However, in a broader context, each task can be decomposed into subtasks whose technological demands can be a challenge, since they require multiple interaction environments as well as transitions between them. Therefore, this work proposes a hybrid technological setup to integrate the advantages of different functional environments. In order to achieve such goal, a semi-immersive environment composed of 3 functional environments was developed and transitions between these environments were exploited during a 3D annotation task in an oil and gas application.},

In this project, we explore the use of a second phone as a controller for Mobile AR. We developed ARTWO, an application that showcases Handheld Dual Phone AR through a series of small demos in which a second phone can be used to perform basic tasks such as pointing, selecting, and drawing, in the context of real use cases. We believe that the Dual Phone AR approach can help address many of the issues faced when using conventional mobile AR interactions, and also serves as a stepping stone to the general use of phones with head-mounted AR systems in the near future.},

This approach aligns with the ``Seamless Reality'' concept, integrating physical and cyber space perception, cognition, and interaction. We detail the development of a prototype system and present findings from a user study that evaluates its effectiveness in a diverse range of AR settings. Our results underscore the potential of AR technologies in smishing detection, contributing to a safer interaction between virtual and real-world elements. The study also delves into aspects of AR display systems, user interface design, and the integration of haptic feedback, offering insights into the broader implications for seamless AR experiences.}

Although many researchers have proposed methods to resolve this issue, the inherent characteristics prevent these displays from delivering a readability on par with that of more traditional displays. As a solution, we explore the use of smartphones as assistive displays to AR HMDs. To validate the feasibility of our approach, we conducted a user study in which we compared a smartphone-assisted hybrid interface against using the HMD only for two different text lengths. The results demonstrate that the hybrid interface yields a lower task load regardless of the text length, although it does not improve task performance. Furthermore, the hybrid interface provides a better experience regarding user comfort, visual fatigue, and perceived readability. Based on these results, we claim that joining the spatial output capabilities of the HMD with the high-resolution display of the smartphone is a viable solution for improving the reading experience in AR.}

  abstract = {We present a concept and early prototype for exploring volumetric medical data, e.g., from MRI or CT scans, in head-mounted Augmented Reality (AR) with a spatially tracked tablet. Our goal is to address the lack of immersion and intuitive input of conventional systems by providing spatial navigation to extract arbitrary slices from volumetric data directly in three-dimensional space. A 3D model of the medical data is displayed in the real environment, fixed to a particular location, using AR. The tablet is spatially moved through this virtual 3D model and shows the resulting slices as 2D images. We present several techniques that facilitate this overall concept, e.g., to place and explore the model, as well as to capture, annotate, and compare slices of the data. Furthermore, we implemented a proof-of-concept prototype that demonstrates the feasibility of our concepts. With our work we want to improve the current way of working with volumetric data slices in the medical domain and beyond.}

Prior work explored leveraging a second device (e.g., Head-mounted displays) to extend the space where users can access large information space with virtual displays anchored on their wrists. Though researchers showed that having an additional virtual screen increased information bandwidth, little is known about the effect of virtual display sizes on users' performance. In this paper, we examined the impact of display sizes on spatial memory, workload, and user experience to better understand the prospects of virtually-augmented displays for smartwatches. Results from a user study revealed that a 4.8 inches display size can be the ``sweet spot'' for the virtually-augmented displays to ensure improved spatial memory performance and better user experience with less workload. Finally, we provided a set of design guidelines focusing to display size, spatial memory, user experience, and workload for designing virtually augmented user interfaces for smartwatches.}

  abstract = {Nowadays, researches on mixed reality (MR) have made a lot of exploration in the aspects of user experience, hardware devices, interaction technologies, application systems, etc. However, more research is still needed to explore how to improve the experience in the shared MR Environment and design appropriate collaborative interaction models. The traditional VR handle can realize tool simulation and 3D interaction, while smartphones can realize 2D interactions such as fast 2D gestures, text input and handwriting. Using the mobile phone as the handle of the MR headset can realize the complementary advantages of the two. In this study, we design a cross-device collaborative system sharing a hybrid reality environment. In the MR Environment, the smartphone will realize the functions of the controller for remote selection and manipulation of objects, and its advantages in 2D interaction can be well applied to some special tasks. We design the user interface with three levels of immersion: high, medium and low. High immersion: We provide a hybrid user interface combining a HoloLens2 and a smartphone. Medium immersion: We provide a 3D user interface represented by HoloLens2. Low immersion: We provide a multi-touch user interface represented by tablet. User studies show that the hybrid user interfaces can bring users satisfactory immersion and interactive experience, but it also needs to design accurate and efficient input methods according to the interactive tasks.},

In this paper, we report on the design and development of Gluey, a user interface that acts as a 'glue' to facilitate seamless input transitions and data movement across displays. Based on requirements we refine for such an interface, Gluey leverages inherent headworn display attributes such as field-of-view tracking and an always-available canvas to redirect input and migrate content across multiple displays, while minimizing device switching costs. We implemented a functional prototype integrating Gluey's numerous interaction possibilities. From our experience in this integration and from user evaluation results, we identify the open challenges in using HWDs to unify the interaction experience in DDEs.},

Our approach aims to complement both MR and physical visualizations. Most current MR visualizations suffer from unreliable tracking, low visual resolution, and imprecise input. Data physicalizations on the other hand, although allowing for natural physical manipulation, are limited in dynamic and interactive modification. We demonstrate how mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets can serve as physical proxies for MR data interactions, creating dynamic visualizations that support precise manipulation and rich input and output. We describe 6 interaction techniques that leverage the combined physicality, sensing, and output capabilities of HMDs and smartphones, and demonstrate those interactions via a prototype system. Based on an evaluation, we outline opportunities for combining the advantages of both MR and physical charts.},

AR-HMDs immerse users by showing datasets stereoscopically, and tablets provide a set of 2D exploration tools. Because AR-HMDs merge the visualization, interaction, and the users' physical spaces, users can also use the tablets as tangible objects in their 3D space. Nonetheless, the tablets' touch displays provide their own visualization and interaction spaces, separated from those of the AR-HMD. This raises several research questions compared to traditional setups. In this paper, we theorize, discuss, and study different available mappings for manual spatial selections using a tangible tablet within an AR-HMD space. We then study the use of this tablet within a 3D AR environment, compared to its use with a 2D external screen.},

We describe a pragmatic approach to interface design that provides users with a large virtual world in which such high-resolution work can be performed. Our approach is based on combining heterogeneous display and interaction device technologies to produce a hybrid user interface. Display and interaction technologies that have relatively low resolution, but which cover a wide (visual and interactive) field are used to form an information surround. Display and interaction technologies that have relatively high resolution over a limited visual and interaction range are used to present concentrated information in one or more selected portions of the surround. These highresolution fields are embedded within the low-resolution surround by choosing and coordinating complementary devices that permit the user to see and interact with both simultaneously. This allows each embedded high-resolution interface to serve as a ""sweet spot"" within which information may be preferentially processed. We have developed a preliminary implementation, described in this paper, that uses a Reflection Technology Private Eye display and a Polhemus sensor to provide the secondary lowresolution surround, and a flat-panel display and mouse to provide the primary high-resolution interface.},

Current approaches either rely on power-intensive sensors, such as cameras for hand tracking, or specialized hardware such as controllers. Previous work has explored the use of familiar, available devices such as smartphones and smartwatches as more a more practical input alternative. However, this approach risks interaction overload -- how can one determine whether the user's gestures on the watch or phone are directed toward control of the XR device or the mobile device itself? To this end, we propose a novel method for cross-device input arbitration based on the relative orientation between the HMD and target device as measured by on-device IMUs. In a validation study with 6 users, we demonstrate 93.7\% accuracy in estimating the intended device of interaction. Our method offers a practical, energy-efficient way to leverage users' existing devices for input and enable seamless cross-device experiences in XR.},

Particularly in the early project stages, teams were uncertain about what data should, and even could, be collected with MR technologies. We designed the Mixed Reality Analytics Toolkit (MRAT) to instrument MR apps via visual editors without programming and enable rapid data collection and filtering for visualizations of MR user sessions. With MRAT, we contribute flexible interaction tracking and task definition concepts, an extensible set of heuristic techniques and metrics to measure task success, and visual inspection tools with in-situ visualizations in MR. Focusing on a multi-user, cross-device MR crisis simulation and triage training app as a case study, we then show the benefits of using MRAT, not only for user testing of MR apps, but also performance tuning throughout the design process.},

A virtual TV mosaic is displayed around the TV screen and used as a GUI to control both TV and MR content. This paper focuses on the collaborative and personalized dimension offered by the experience. Unlike most AR applications, it can be simultaneously run by several users using different devices. The users can share content with others while keeping a personalized display. The added-value of such an extended TV experience has been demonstrated through complementary types of content, and user feedback confirms a real interest in this new kind of home entertainment, at the same time immersive, interactive, collaborative and personalized.},

The scenes, which vary in complexity, are viewable using virtual reality headsets, smartphones, and any device that supports a web browser. By providing access to the specific domain of virtual reality to students, the system aims to make computer science concepts tangible for novice programmers.

We identify two general approaches for controlling a mouse cursor in SAR: perspective-based approaches based on raycasting, such as Nacenta et. al's Perspective Cursor, and geometry-based approaches that closely associate cursor movement with surface topology. For the latter, we introduce Everywhere Cursor, a geometry-based approach for indirect mouse cursor control for complex 3D surface geometry in SAR. A controlled experiment compares approaches. Results show the geometry-based Everywhere Cursor improves accuracy and precision by 29\% to 60\% on average in a tracing task, but when traversing long distances, the perspective-based Perspective Cursor and Raycasting techniques are 22\% to 49\% faster, albeit with 4\% to 10\% higher error rates.},

Immersive analytics tools have recently emerged to support such analysis in situ, yet the complexity of the data also warrants an ex-situ analysis using more traditional non-immersive visual analytics setups. To bridge the gap between both approaches, we introduce ReLive: a mixed-immersion visual analytics framework for exploring and analyzing mixed reality user studies. ReLive combines an in-situ virtual reality view with a complementary ex-situ desktop view. While the virtual reality view allows users to relive interactive spatial recordings replicating the original study, the synchronized desktop view provides a familiar interface for analyzing aggregated data. We validated our concepts in a two-step evaluation consisting of a design walkthrough and an empirical expert user study.},

A user study reveals that participants appreciated the novel interaction concept, indicating the potential for spatially-aware tablets in augmented reality. Based on our fndings, we provide design insights to foster the application of spatially-aware touch devices in augmented reality and research implications indicating areas that need further investigation.},

A defining aspect of our system is the ongoing creation of surfaces from unorganized collections of 3D curves. These surfaces serve a dual purpose: as 3D canvases to map strokes drawn on a 2D tablet, and as shape proxies to occlude the physical environment and hidden curves in a 3D sketch. SymbiosisSketch users draw interchangeably on a 2D tablet or in 3D within an ergonomically comfortable canonical volume, mapped to arbitrary scale in AR.

These are used to develop a vocabulary of interaction techniques to demonstrate how a tablet's precise touch input capability, physical shape, metaphorical associations, and natural compatibility with barehand mid-air input can be used in VR. For example, transforming objects with touch input, ""cutting"" objects by using the tablet as a physical ""knife"", navigating in 3D by using the tablet as a viewport, and triggering commands by interleaving bare-hand input around the tablet. Key aspects of the vocabulary are evaluated with users, with results validating the approach.},

The everyday tool handling experience of working with pen and notebooks is extended to create a three dimensional two-handed interface, that supports easy-to-understand manipulation tasks in augmented and virtual environments. In the design step we take advantage from the freedom, given by our very low demands on hardware and augment form and functionality to this device. On the basis of examples from object manipulation, augmented research environments and scientific visualization we show the generality of applicability. Although being in the first stages implementation, we consider the wide spectrum of suitability for different purposes.},

  abstract = {Current interaction modalities for mobile Augmented Reality (AR) are tedious and lack expressiveness. To overcome these prevalent limitations, we developed and evaluated a multimodal interaction concept by pairing a smartphone as an input and output modality for mobile AR. In a user study (n = 24), we investigated the effects on interaction speed, accuracy, and task load for (1) virtual object manipulation as well as (2) interaction with established graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Our findings show that a smartphone-based AR controller results in significantly faster and more accurate object manipulation with reduced task load than state-of-art mid-air gestures. Our results also indicate a significant enhancement for using the physical touchscreen as a modality compared to mid-air gestures for GUI interaction. We conclude that interaction in mobile AR environments can be improved by utilizing a smartphone as an omnipresent controller. Additionally, we discuss how future AR systems can benefit from tangible touchscreens as an additional and complementary interaction modality.},

Our work emphasizes the importance of interaction continuity as a guideline in the design and evaluation of transitional interfaces within a hybrid user interface (HUI). Finally, an exploratory study demonstrates how this design aspect is perceived by users during transitions in an HUI composed by three interactive environments.},

  abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) head-worn displays (HWDs) allow users to view and interact with virtual objects anchored in the 3D space around them. These devices extend users' digital interaction space compared to traditional desktop computing environments by both allowing users to interact with a larger virtual display and by affording new interactions (e.g., intuitive 3D manipulations) with virtual content. Yet, 2D desktop displays still have advantages over AR HWDs for common computing tasks and will continue to be used well into the future. Because of their not entirely overlapping set of affordances, AR HWDs and 2D desktops may be useful in a hybrid configuration; that is, users may benefit from being able to work on computing tasks in either environment (or simultaneously in both environments) while transitioning virtual content between them. In support of such computing environments, we propose a prototyping framework for bidirectional Cross-Reality interactions between a desktop and an AR HWD. We further implemented a proof-of-concept seamless Desktop-AR display space, and describe two concrete use cases for our framework. In future work we aim to further develop our proof-of-concept into the proposed framework.}

With the increasing availability of genome annotations and the development of powerful reconstruction tools, biomolecular networks continue to grow ever larger. While visual exploration can facilitate the understanding of such networks, the network sizes represent a major challenge for current visualisation systems. Building on promising results from the area of immersive analytics, which among others deals with the potential of immersive visualisation for data analysis, we present a concept for a hybrid user interface that combines a classical desktop environment with a virtual reality environment for the visual exploration of large biomolecular networks and corresponding data. We present system requirements and design considerations, describe a resulting concept, an envisioned technical realisation, and a systems biology usage scenario.

Participants were allowed to propose interactions belonging to various input modalities or a combination of interactions that utilize multiple input modalities. We labeled the observed data and analyzed the resulting 1200 input observations to derive a set of recommended interactions. We found that mid-air hand gestures Drag, Tap, and Grab were the most commonly proposed interactions and should be considered as the primary interaction for CR virtual objects transition assisted with other interactions and input modalities as the supplementary base on different user scenarios.},

  abstract = {See-through Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) offer interesting opportunities to augment the interaction space around screens, especially around horizontal tabletops. In such context, HMDs can display surrounding vertical virtual windows to complement the tabletop content with data displayed in close vicinity. However, the effects of such combination on the visual acquisition of targets in the resulting combined display space have scarcely been explored. In this paper we conduct a study to explore visual acquisitions in such contexts, with a specific focus on the analysis of visual transitions between the horizontal tabletop display and the vertical virtual displays (in front and on the side of the tabletop). To further study the possible visual perception of the tabletop content out of the HMD and its impact on visual interaction, we distinguished two solutions for displaying information on the horizontal tabletop: using the see-through HMD to display virtual content over the tabletop surface (virtual overlay), i.e. the content is only visible inside the HMD's FoV, or using the tabletop itself (tabletop screen). 12 participants performed visual acquisition tasks involving the horizontal and vertical displays. We measured the time to perform the task, the head movements, the portions of the displays visible in the HMD's field of view, the physical fatigue and the user's preference. Our results show that it is faster to acquire virtual targets in the front display than on the side. Results reveal that the use of the virtual overlay on the tabletop slows down the visual acquisition compared to the use of the tabletop screen, showing that users exploit the visual perception of the tabletop content on the peripheral visual space. We were also able to quantify when and to which extent targets on the tabletop can be acquired without being visible within the HMD's field of view when using the tabletop screen, i.e. by looking under the HMD. These results lead to design recommendations for more efficient, comfortable and integrated interfaces combining tabletop and surrounding vertical virtual displays.},
